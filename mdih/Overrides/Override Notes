Override Notes:

[1] to the "staff" CPT custom field cws-staff as part of it's serialized data:
		cws-staff-residency
		cws-staff-fellowship
		cws-staff-boardcert
	These are added in clinico/core/staff.php(to add them in the backend)  & single-staff.php (to show them)

  examples:  Timber Gorman (1361), Micael Mason (1877), Phillip Brooks (272016)

  in single-staff.php will only show them for "doctors", which is determined by a position of "Physican"
